# BiaoTeach

Started app for music teacher now.
They could use that to manage their teaching event.
We would make this easier and better, because not every musician is a technique guy.
Expecting this project working out.

# Setup
1. yarn restart
2. yarn migrate
3. yarn console

# TODO List
1. Set up ruby gem env like gourami, sequel, graphql and whatever we need.
2. Set up the initial database structure.
3. Set up Frontend Env(Android RN first, because my wife's phone is android), let's see if it should be another container or not.
4. Set up deploy process.
5. Test and improve.
6. Make more scripts for easy setup and guide for init setup.
7. Move migrate script to source code so no exposure of db pass.
